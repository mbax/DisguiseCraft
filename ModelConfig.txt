# DisguiseCraft Configuration
#

# Disguise PVP
#	In order for players to be able to attack those who
#	are disguised, you must have the ProtocolLib plugin
#	installed on your server:
#		http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/protocollib/
disguisePVP=true

# Optional Event Listeners
#	Any of the following can be disabled to increase
#	efficiency or cater to server-specific needs.
playerHeldItemChange=true
playerArmSwingAnimation=true
playerSneakAnimation=true
disguiseDamageAnimation=true
disguiseDeathAnimation=true
itemPickupAnimation=true
disguiseArmorUpdates=true

# Update Notification
#	With this set to true, the plugin will check for
#	and notify those who have the "disguisecraft.update"
#	permission of plugin updates upon joining.
updateNotification=true

# Unnatural Slime/MagmaCube Sizes
#	Here you can set the size for the extra slime
#	subtypes given. You can choose any number between
#	-128 and 127, but beware that negative slime
#	size values will result in upside-down slimes.
#	These slime properties will also apply
#	to magma cubes.
bigger=20
massive=50
godzilla=100

# Undisguise on Quit
#	With this set to true, any disguised player
#	who leaves the server will be undisguised.
quitUndisguise=true

# Bandwidth Reduction
#	To keep disguises perfectly in-sync with
#	the wearer, DisguiseCraft uses the entity
#	teleportation packet instead of the 
#	smaller relative motion packets that
#	the Vanilla MineCraft server uses.
#	Set this to true if you wish to have
#	disguise movements handled in the less
#	bandwidth-intensive manner.
bandwidthReduction=false

# Disguise Movement Update Threading
#	Typically, DisguiseCraft uses the PlayerMoveEvent
#	in order to track disguises. However, this has
#	proven to cause lag on servers with large
#	numbers of disguised players. Use this option
#	to place updates into separate threads. You can
#	also set the frequency (in ticks) that they update
#	the player disguise position.
movementUpdateThreading=false
movementUpdateFrequency=4

# Disguise NoPickup Default
#	With this option set to true, any disguises
#	created will have the "nopickup" property
#	automatically set.
#	This means that disguised players are
#	automatically set to not pick up items.
nopickupDefault=false

# Disguise Attack Process Interval
#	To greatly improve performance, DisguiseCraft
#	processes "attacks on disguises" in a separate
#	polling thread. This is how often (in ticks)
#	that this thread will process attacks.
attackInterval=2
